### Sprint 1: Infrastructure & "The Handshake"

**User Story 1: Monorepo & UI Template Foundation**
- **Requirement**: I want to initialize a unified monorepo structure using Turborepo and `pnpm workspaces`, and migrate the provided HTML/Tailwind dashboard template into the Next.js app.
- **Reason**: So that I have a high-performance development workflow and a ready-to-use visual interface for testing end-to-end connectivity.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Root `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` correctly define workspaces for `apps/` and shared project tooling, with database migrations living under `db/`.
    - `turbo.json` is configured to orchestrate task pipelines for build, lint, and test.
    - The provided static HTML/Tailwind template is stored in `design/frontend-template/` as the unmodified reference source.
    - The template is successfully migrated into functional Next.js React components within `apps/web`.

**Implementation Note**
- Keep raw template files, screenshots, and copied vendor assets in `design/frontend-template/`.
- Keep production app code only in `apps/web`.
- Do not edit the raw template in place once migration work starts; use it as a reference source of truth.
